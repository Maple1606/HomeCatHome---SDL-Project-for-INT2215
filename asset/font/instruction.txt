Little Boy has just lost his precious kitten.
He is on his way to bring her home. The journey 
he sets out isn't always easy. There are various 
obstacles that can slown him down. Don't let him 
down, but help him overcome all the challenges 
so that he can finally see his friend again.

As soon as the game begins, Little Boy will    
move at a constant speed. When reaching the 
screen's edges or barriers, he'll instantly
change his direction.
...                                            
Do not touch the traps, or the character would 
injure badly. You'll have to start the level again
if you want to pass. Use your mouse and brain to 
change the order of six puzzles, thus changing 
your path so that you can reach the destination.
